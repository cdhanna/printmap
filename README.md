# printmap

The goal of this project is to generate topographical vector-based graphics for anywhere on the world. The intent is that those graphics could be used as cut-lines for a laser cutter.
In theory, there will be a dotnetcore backend that produces the svg, given a lat/lng bounding box. There will be a REACT frontend to make queries.
